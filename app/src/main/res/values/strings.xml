    <string name="separating__laundry_description">
        Separate your laundry into clothes that are of the same fabric.
        One pile can be made up of heavy fabrics, the other with lightweight or thin fabrics.
        This way, it will be easier for you to choose the correct washing cycle for your clothes.
        After you separate into the type of fabric, you will need to separate by the color of the fabric.
        This will prevent colors from bleeding into each other and ruining your clothes.
    </string>
    <string name="treating_stains_description">
        Always treat stains as soon as they occur.
        You can either use a laundry detergent or a stain remover and make sure to gently rub it in.
        Let it sit for around five minutes before washing it away from the clothing item.
        You can also treat stains by letting them soak for thirty minutes in cold water.
    </string>
    <string name="loading_detergent">
        Depending on the type of your laundry machine, either put the detergent in the sliding drawer (of a front loading washing machine).
        Or if you have a top loading washing machine, you can put the detergent directly into the drum after filling it with water.
        Make sure to choose the correct laundry detergent for your type of washing machine.
        Also, take into account to buy a laundry detergent if you have sensitive skin or are prone to allergies.

    <string name="using_bleach_description">
        Adding bleach to your laundry helps keep your white clothes bright.
        Make sure to look for the correct place to add it based on the type of your washing machine.
    </string>
    <string name="fabric_softener_description">
        If you want to give your clothes a soft touch or if your clothes come out of the laundry machine stiff,
        you need to add fabric softener to your laundry.
        Make sure to look for the correct place to add it based on the type of your washing machine.
    </string>
    <string name="choosing_wash_cycle_and_temperature_description">
        Make sure to read the care tags on your clothing. If you don\'t understand them, use <![CDATA[<b>Laundry Symbols</b>]]> to figure out
        what each one means. For sturdy clothing, use the normal setting on your washing machine. This usually will
        make the washing machine wash and rinse in fast cycles. If you have very dirty clothing items, then you
        will need to use the heavy duty setting.
        The permanent press setting is used for clothes that might wrinkling, which is caused by the fabrics they are made
        from. Like nylon and rayon. This will cause the washing machine to have a slower cycle at the end of the wash.
        For clothing items that are delicate, like lingerie, use the delicate cycle.
